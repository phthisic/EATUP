#### EATUP Prototype
demo.apk can be opened with Android mobile phone.

or if you want to view the source code, please download the "EATUP" file and open it with Unity.

Might take several minutes to import all the resources.

In the AR camera config, change the type of your camera. If you do not have any webcam, you can use your phone as the camera. ( Application like IVCam might be useful here.)

Should be good to go if your computer has a camera.
